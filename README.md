Hi, I'm Lekhana S K, a Computer Science Engineering student currently learning and exploring MERN stack development. I enjoy building websites and understanding how frontend and backend work together.

Right now I’m practicing MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js by creating small projects and improving my JavaScript skills. I like solving coding problems and learning new technologies step by step.

My goal is to gain real-world experience, work on practical projects, and grow into a good full-stack developer. Reach Me:lekhanalekhu1925@gmail.com
